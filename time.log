		TOTAL:	

I write this in recovery from the trauma of debugging LZW. It was incredibly frusturating to prod at my code and guess at what caused a few byte errors in Gutenberg Etexts. Particularly hellish was getting overflow, and wondering why the heck I was receiving a '0' code in the middle of my decompression. The worst was debugging the pruning algorithim-- and syncing encode and decode for this. In particular, my tables weren't synced-- and even after that, they became out of sync.s
